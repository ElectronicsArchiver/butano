/**
 * @defgroup sprite Sprites
 *
 * Small animated objects that can move freely from the background.
 *
 * In GBA's jargon they are called OBJs.
 */

/**
 * @defgroup window Windows
 *
 * They allow to divide the screen into regions.
 *
 * For each one of these regions, they can show or hide sprites, backgrounds and blending between them.
 */

/**
 * @defgroup text Text
 *
 * Butano's text system, based on sprites.
 *
 * Currently, it supports 8x8 and 8x16 fixed width AND variable width fonts.
 *
 * Text can be printed in one sprite per character or multiple characters per sprite.
 *
 * Also, UTF-8 characters are supported.

 * @defgroup container Containers
 *
 * STL like containers with the capacity defined at compile time.

 * They don't throw exceptions. Instead, asserts are used to ensure valid usage.

/**
 * @defgroup assert Asserts
 *
 * Butano's assert system.

 * It can be disabled by defining \a BTN_CFG_ASSERT_ENABLED as \a <b>false</b>.
 *
 * Note that these asserts can be used in constexpr contexts (is_constant_evaluated() returns <b>true</b>).
